# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-21)

**Core value:** An agent that takes fuzzy stakeholder input and produces a formally structured, persistently stored, machine-checkable requirement.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 — Bug Triage

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 5 (Bug Triage)
Plan: 0 of 7 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-04-21 — Roadmap created, STATE.md initialised

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phase 0 is a hard prerequisite — 7 cascading bugs block all skill imports
- Roadmap: New `elicit-requirements` skill required; must not merge with `project-update`
- Roadmap: FRET refinement is field-by-field (COMPONENT → SCOPE → CONDITION → TIMING → RESPONSE), one turn per field
- Roadmap: Soft-delete only, always — no hard DELETE on any requirement row
- Roadmap: Three-gate persistence model — project, requirement, and FRET each require explicit user confirmation

### Pending Todos

9 pending todos in .planning/todos/pending/ — see `/gsd-check-todos`

Topics: AI governance reqs, conflict detection, external links, FRET formalisation, Gherkin/BDD generation, ML lifecycle domain knowledge, SysML formalisation, traceability management, VCS/CI linkage (all v2 scope).

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 0 must complete before any feature work; test suite currently hides all bugs via over-permissive MagicMock patching
- `fret_grammar.md` type names misalign with `RequirementType` Enum codes — must be corrected before Phase 3
