# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-21)

**Core value:** An agent that takes fuzzy stakeholder input and produces a formally structured, persistently stored, machine-checkable requirement.
**Current focus:** Phase 0 — Bug Triage

## Current Position

Phase: 0 of 5 (Bug Triage)
Plan: 1 of 6 in current phase (00-01 complete)
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-04-23 — Plan 00-01 executed: db.py import blocker fixed

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 4%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 8 minutes
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 0 Bug Triage | 1 | 8 min | 8 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 00-01 (8 min)
- Trend: baseline established

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phase 0 is a hard prerequisite — 7 cascading bugs block all skill imports
- Roadmap: New `elicit-requirements` skill required; must not merge with `project-update`
- Roadmap: FRET refinement is field-by-field (COMPONENT → SCOPE → CONDITION → TIMING → RESPONSE), one turn per field
- Roadmap: Soft-delete only, always — no hard DELETE on any requirement row
- Roadmap: Three-gate persistence model — project, requirement, and FRET each require explicit user confirmation
- 00-01: models.py D-01 through D-05 applied in plan 00-01 (not 00-02) — required to unblock db.py import; plan 00-02 executor should verify and proceed to any remaining work
- 00-01: shared/ was root-owned; workaround via parent-dir rename; shared.bak/ left on disk, gitignored

### Pending Todos

9 pending todos in .planning/todos/pending/ — see `/gsd-check-todos`

Topics: AI governance reqs, conflict detection, external links, FRET formalisation, Gherkin/BDD generation, ML lifecycle domain knowledge, SysML formalisation, traceability management, VCS/CI linkage (all v2 scope).

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 0 must complete before any feature work; test suite currently hides all bugs via over-permissive MagicMock patching
- `fret_grammar.md` type names misalign with `RequirementType` Enum codes — must be corrected before Phase 3

## Deferred Items
